# Oxidized_lipids_Martini2

## About The Project

insanex.py

Modified version of Martini insane.py to generate lipid bilayer systems containing oxidized lipid models based on Maritni v2.2 12-bead POPC and DOPC.

Two examples are provided.

1. Example simulation setups for membrane systems with different peroxidized positions. 
2. Example simulation setups for membrane systems with different peroxidized levels.
